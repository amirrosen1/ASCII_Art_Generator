# ASCII Art Generator

## Overview

This project provides a Java-based solution for converting images to ASCII art. The application reads image
 files and converts the pixels into corresponding ASCII characters to create a text-based representation of
  the image. The output can be displayed on the console or exported as HTML.

## Features

- Converts images to ASCII art
- Supports console and HTML output formats
- Customizable character mapping for fine-tuning the art

## Files and Classes

- `AsciiArtAlgorithm.java`: Core algorithm for converting images to ASCII art.
- `KeyboardInput.java`: Handles user input for the application.
- `Shell.java`: Provides a command-line interface for the application.
- `AsciiOutput.java`: Abstract class for defining different ASCII output methods.
- `ConsoleAsciiOutput.java`: Implements ASCII art output in the console.
- `HtmlAsciiOutput.java`: Implements ASCII art output in HTML format.
- `Image.java`: Handles image reading and processing.
- `CharConverter.java`: Maps image pixels to ASCII characters.
- `SubImgCharMatcher.java`: Matches sub-images to corresponding ASCII characters.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An image file for conversion

## How to Run

1. Compile all Java files using `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
